ShoppingAID

ShoppingAID is an app that serves as a helper to shopping navigation and management. It allows you to search a certain shopping from within your home, and check which stores it has, where it is, so you can decide before hand if the store you want to go to is in that specific shopping or not, or find alternatives. 

If you do decide to go to a certain shopping, when you get there the first thing you can do is save where you parked, be it outside or inside, through 2 different methods. If you decide to park outside, it'll save your location and then give you the opportunity to consult it if you wnd up forgetting where you parked. If you park inside instead, you can save where you parked through the floor, letter and nuimber of the parking space.

From within the shopping, and as long as it has support for it, you can navigate through the map from store to store, similarly to what Google Maps does, or consult the stores, or some information about the shopping in general.
